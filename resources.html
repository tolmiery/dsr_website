                <h1 class="sub-title">Requesting Accommocations</h1>
                <p>The steps for requesting initial accommodations are:</p>
		    <ol>
			    <li>Complete an <a href="request_form.pdf"> <strong>accommodations request form</strong></a>.</li>
			    <li>Acquire documentation of your disability from your doctor.</li>
			    <li>Submit all documentation, along with your request form, to Disability Student Services. Claire Mahoney, the director of the DSS, is reachable at 
				    <a href = "mailto:dss@rpi.edu">dss@rpi.edu</a> or <a href = "mailto:mahonc6@rpi.edu">mahonc6@rpi.edu</a>.</li>
			    <li>Meet with Claire to discuss your accommodations and how to alert your professors.</li>
			    <li>After meeting with Claire, she will send you an accommodations memo outlining your approved accommodations. Distribute your memo to your professors and meet with them to discuss logistics.
				    It's best practice to distribute your memo at the beginning of the semester. Those with testing accommodations should make sure to distribute their memos before their first exam.</li>
		    </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Each academic year, you will be required to renew your accommodations. The process is:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete the <a href="request_form.pdf"> <strong>accommodations request</strong></a> form and note any changes to your previous accommodations.</li>
                <li>If your documentation has gone out-of-date since the last academic year, you may be asked to
                    send up-to-date documentation. Likewise, you may need to submit new documentation to support new accommodations.</li>
                <li>Claire will send you an accommodations memo outlining your approved accommodations. 
                    The distribution process is the same as for an initial accommodations memo.</li>
            </ol>
